Decred On-Chain: Block Times 

- Block times initially caught my attention because they are natural oscillators i.e. block times have targets, and oscillate around those times
- Decred is very unique in that it difficulty adjusts very frequetnly (every 144 blocks) so mining data is quite responsive
- I like the idea of looking at block times more than hashrate and difficulty due to its oscillating nature, even though this approach seems taboo. you could also argue that hashrate mixed with difficulty --> block times, so you're kind of cutting through the noise to something substantially higher signal by looking at block times
- when you look at bitcoin mining capitulations, you'll see (in a chart I will add) that miners provide very little gravity, allowing price to float following it - which will be bullish for DCR when this miner capitulation ends
- one thing that i've learned about the difference in dcr and btc on-chain data is that dcr's data is substantially more responsive and trend heavy, whereas bitcoin's is less responsive but for that reason is incredibly high signal when it does respond. mining is no different
- people focus a ton on miner capitulation, but dont talk enough about mining getting overheated and weighing on the price in that fashion
- the argument within this piece is that extreme mining conditions upwards or downwards are bearish, as they squeeze miners and cause more natural selling (capitulation only covers one side of the coin)
- need to create an image that has a matrix, showing (1) difficulty and (2) price, and how it impacts miners. this will help ppl understand it much better
- one thing ive noticed across a lot of different mining models is that they require assumptions. whenever i make an analytical tool i *ideally* would like to make it (1) as simple as possible and (2) assumption minimized - looking at block times allows me to do that (although there are some interesting nuances with hashrate / difficulty worth exploring in the future)
- in decred, miners earn 60% of block rewards and are thus the largest natural sellers of DCR. one thing that needs to be mentioned is that Decred is still a small network - so miners likely are a healthy chunk of the supply side. so, when they're sweating - we're likely to see it reflected in price action. this also goes for any on-chain cohort within the network like stakers / contractors paid from the treasury - their actions on-chain whether bullish or bearish shouldn't be discounted
- in this piece i wanna provide a few tools that (1) capture extremes of mining and (2) the mining trend
- the trend following tool shows that block time trends are neutral, because block times can slow down even in bullish environments (due to difficulty frequently adjusting upwards instead of every two weeks)
