- **Description**: 
- Tickets that have not voted within the Decred network after being live for 142 days expire and locked DCR are released. This attribute makes 142 a significant number within the network, and one that should be specifically tracked when analyzing ticket data. The 142 day sum of USD that has gone into tickets gives users a glance at the psychology of HODLers by showing historically good buys are when network value < 25% of ticket purchased over the previous 142 days.

![CHART2](https://github.com/permabullnino/nino_on_chain/blob/master/CHART%20IMAGES/DCR_CHARTS/HODLER%20CONVERSION%20RATE.PNG)
**Description:**
- HODLer Conversion Rates show which stakehodlers within the network are dominating the transactional flows denominated DCR. The stakeholder groups are (1) HODLers i.e. ticket holders and (2) Marginal Buyers / Sellers i.e. standard transactors. Absence of group 2 generally has resulted in bearish price action, and viceversa for the presence of group 2 stakeholders.

![CHART3](https://github.com/permabullnino/nino_on_chain/blob/master/CHART%20IMAGES/DCR_CHARTS/LT_REL_SELLPOWER.PNG)
**Description:**
- LT selling power is a simple metric that tracks the value of block rewards today versus the cumulative sum of block rewards issued to date. Idea was initially created for BTC, and the patterns strongly tracked historically strong places to buy sell BTC in a market cycle high / low.

![CHART4](https://github.com/permabullnino/nino_on_chain/blob/master/CHART%20IMAGES/DCR_CHARTS/ON%20CHAIN%20DCRBTC%20PRICE.PNG)
**Description:**
- The On-Chain DCRBTC price calculates DCRBTC price by diving Decred's realized price by Bitcoin's realized price. This effectively calculates an on-chain cost-basis DCRBTC price, and tracks the dynamic between the two networks over time.

![CHART5](https://github.com/permabullnino/nino_on_chain/blob/master/CHART%20IMAGES/DCR_CHARTS/STRONG_HAND.PNG)
**Description:**
- The Strong Hand Market Cap + Ratio provides a new way of analyzing Decred's fair value, which is calculated by using ticket buying to determine what the "highest bidder" believes the network is worth versus what it's actually trading at on spot markets.

![CHART6](https://github.com/permabullnino/nino_on_chain/blob/master/CHART%20IMAGES/DCR_CHARTS/ST_REL_SELLPOWER.PNG)
**Description:**
- A measure of block reward value today versus the sum of block rewards issued over the past year. This metric is  very similar to the well-known Puell Multiple.

![CHART7](https://github.com/permabullnino/nino_on_chain/blob/master/CHART%20IMAGES/DCR_CHARTS/SUPPLY_MOVED_ADJ.PNG)
**Description:**
- This tool measures the supply moved over the past 142 days, adjusted for supply - which allows users to do an apples to apples comparsion of on-chain flows over time.

![CHART8](https://github.com/permabullnino/nino_on_chain/blob/master/CHART%20IMAGES/DCR_CHARTS/THROUGHPUT_THERMOMETER.PNG)
**Description:**
- The Throughput Thermometer takes the approach from the adjusted coins moved model (the metric explained above) and applies it across networks, to evaluate on-chain activity between networks more fairly. When one network is moving more coins on a pound for pound basis, it is generally accompanied with price appreciation versus the other side of the trading pair.

![CHART9](https://github.com/permabullnino/nino_on_chain/blob/master/CHART%20IMAGES/DCR_CHARTS/TICKET%20CHOP.PNG)
**Description:** 
- This metric is comparable to the Choppiness Index used in traditional markets, which effectively measures dormant / released energy within a particular asset. As such, this tool shows when tickets are relatively overbought / oversold - letting network stakehodlers know when ticket purchases should expect to slow down or ramp up over the short to medium term.
