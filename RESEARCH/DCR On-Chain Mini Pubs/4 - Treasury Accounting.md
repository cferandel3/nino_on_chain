# Decred On-Chain: Treasury Accounting

Decred is many things:

1) A money
2) A high assurance accounting machine
3) A distributed workforce aiming to build on points 1 & 2

The Decred Treasury is the foundation for point 3, which funds a distributed collective of contractors ranging from developers to project marketers. There are a few things which make the Treasury funds unique:

- Funding is limited: there are currently ~600,000 DCR in the Treasury balance and approximately 900,000 DCR remaining in Treasury issuance
- Treasury funds are allocated by those with skin in the game, which in Decred's case is stakers (i.e. ticket holders)

With these factors considered, we can make a few takeaways:

- Ticket holders need to be discerning over where Treasury DCR are allocated, as funds are limited and can run out
- Ticket holders are looking for an ROI on their invested Treasury DCR

Through the duration of the Decred bear market there have been a swath of proposals published, approved, rejected, and even abandoned. Inevitably (and understandably), each proposal came with concerns over where Treasury funds were allocated, and whether the ROI on a proposal passed the sniff test. As someone who was an accountant in a prior career-life, this presented itself as an opportunity to nerd out and hopefully provide some useful tools for better understanding the Decred Treasury today and into the future. 

Within we will run through a high-level accountant's report to the Decred Treasury via the following approach:

- Basic view of the Treasury including balance, spends, etc.
- DCR Contractor P/L
- DCR Treasury Flows
- DCR Treasury Budgeting
- DCR Treasury Runway
- DCR Treasury Returns
