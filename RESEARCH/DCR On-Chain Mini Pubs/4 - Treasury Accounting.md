## Treasury Foundations

Decred is many things:

1) A money
2) A high assurance accounting machine
3) A distributed workforce aiming to build on points 1 & 2

The Decred Treasury is the foundation for point 3, which funds a distributed collective of contractors ranging from developers to project marketers. There are a few things which make the Treasury funds unique:

- Funding is limited: there are currently ~600,000 DCR in the Treasury balance and approximately 900,000 DCR remaining in Treasury issuance
- Treasury funds are allocated by those with skin in the game, which in Decred's case is stakers (i.e. ticket holders)

With these factors considered, we can make a few takeaways:

- Ticket holders need to be discerning over where Treasury DCR are allocated, as funds are limited and can run out
- Ticket holders are looking for an ROI on their invested Treasury DCR

Through the duration of the Decred bear market there have been a swath of proposals published, approved, rejected, and even abandoned. Inevitably (and understandably), each proposal came with concerns over where Treasury funds were allocated, and whether the ROI on a proposal passed the sniff test. As someone who was an accountant in a prior career-life, this presented itself as an opportunity to nerd out and hopefully provide some useful tools for better understanding the Decred Treasury today and into the future. 

Within we will run through a high-level accountant's report to the Decred Treasury via the following approach:

- Basic view of the Treasury including balance, spends, etc.
- DCR Contractor P/L
- DCR Treasury Flows
- DCR Treasury Budgeting
- DCR Treasury Runway
- DCR Treasury Returns

## Basic View of the Treasury

Below we will cover the basics of the Decred Treasury from both a DCR and USD focused point of view. Establishing a baseline within this section should provide sufficient context for the remaining analysis.

**Note: Decred contractors bill to the Treasury in USD, and the sum of DCR sent to contractors is determined by dividing sum of USD billed by the average DCRUSD price of the month work is being billed towards**

![Basic View DCR](https://github.com/permabullnino/nino_on_chain/blob/master/RESEARCH/DCR%20On-Chain%20Mini%20Pub%20Images/4%20-%20Treasury%20Accounting/Basic%20View%20DCR.PNG)

- The chart above plots the Treasury (white line) and cumulative sum of DCR paid to contractors (blue line) through the project's lifetime
- Red bars show the daily sum of DCR sent to contractors

- The Treasury balance has hovered around 600k - 630k DCR since early 2019
- Cumulative DCR sent to contractors currently sits around 400k DCR
- Maximum daily spends of DCR has consistently hit ~17.5k since early 2019, around the same time the cumulative spends line started to accelerate upwards

- To date, there seems to be two different eras of DCR Treasury spends
- Era 1: small DCR outlay, and payments paid in smaller / separate batches
- Era 2: larger DCR outlay, and payments made in larger / joint amounts
- These two eras are divided by the introduction of *Politeia*, which launched late 2018 - representing a clear shift in the Decred DAO by formalizing the contracting process
- Another divider of these eras, and what can *at least* explain the increased DCR outlay is the DCRUSD price moving to bear market lows - where price has settled since then

- The chart above plots the Treasury value in USD (white line) and cumulative sum of USD paid to contractors (blue line) through the project's lifetime
- Red bars show the daily sum of USD sent to contractors
- USD outlay is calculated by using the USD price on the day the DCR were transacted

- Treasury Value: ~$10 - $11 Million
- Cumulative Spends: ~$8 - $9 Million
- Max USD Daily Outlay: ~$400k

- The value of the Treasury collided with Cumulative Spends on the "doomsday candle" from Covid-19 shutdowns

- Since the middle of 2017, contractor pay has consistently remained between $100k and $300k
- This well defined range of spending can be used as a possible measure of two things: (1) contractor retention and (2) budgeting

- The easiest way to measure contractor retention / growth is by looking at the USD value of Treasury spends
- As such, the consistent spending can be viewed as bullish because it signals contractors remain within the working ecosystem
- Or, this can be viewed as bearish because it signals little growth in *new* contractors

- From a budgeting perspective the data looks quite encouraging: in a largely sideways DCRUSD market spending has also remained sideways. This signals that stakeholders are conscious of not exhausting funds

- USD payment data can also help stakeholders understand what share of Treasury spend a proposal is budgeting for
- The table above assumes the monthly spend of the Treasury is around $200k, and takes various monthly spend budgets for an individual contractor to estimate their portion of the total monthly charge
- By seeing what share of total Treasury outlay a certain proposal is budgeting for on a monthly basis, stakeholders can come up with their own benchmarks for what they consider reasonable
- The above is just a simple example of mental budgeting individual stakeholders can perform with available Treasury payment data (more on this in future sections)
